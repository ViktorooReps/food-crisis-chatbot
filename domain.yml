        I can help you compare commodity prices across multiple countries using data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX).
        You can ask me questions like:
        - 'Compare the price of milk and bread in Kazakhstan and Angola for the past two decades'
        - 'Show me the latest wheat flour prices in Armenia'
        - 'How can I compare prices in Colombia and Gabon'
        
        Just mention the commodity and the countries you're interested in.
